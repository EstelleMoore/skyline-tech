To appropriately organise data in rows and columns, or even in a more complex structure, a table in CSS is used to apply the various style properties to the HTML Table components. The table's layout can be seen using the CSS table-layout property. this is slightly different from the first table, because this has to do with arranging it serially, without grade or score, and no icons. Basically, this attribute is used to set the layout method for table.
